## Mastering Deep Learning in 2024
- Continuing the journey of [Mastering Deep Learning from 2023](https://github.com/ajinkyakolhe112/Mastering-Deep-Learning-in-2023)
- Deep Learning is **"both, a Science and an Engineering domain"**
  - Both domains have completely different & generally philosophies
  - **Science** is concerned with       - *Theory, How & Why*
  - **Engineering** is concerned with   - *How & Hacking with Code & Applications*
  - We need to master both, not just one. Naturally we have one dominant style, so for mastery, eventually we need to master both styles
  - Different Types of Data Scientists

| Type of Data Scientist | Scientist   | Engineer       |

- My **focus in 2024 is on Engineering side of Data Science**. Hence will focus more on solving Kaggle Problems, Other Business Problems etc...

### 2024 Goals
|                            | Progress                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
1: Tensorflow Developer Certificate*        | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
2: Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer*  | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) | 
3: Azure Data Science Associate             | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) | 
4: Kaggle **GrandMaster**                      | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |

Even though Pytorch wins over Tensorflow, but Tensorflow Certificate is useful for getting a job. Also Pytorch Certificate hasn't been launched yet.
