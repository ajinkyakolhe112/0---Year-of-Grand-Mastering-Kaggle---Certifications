# Mastering LLMs & NLP in 2024
- Deep Learning is made up of 2 major domains
  1. Computer Vision
  2. Natural Language Processing 
- Continuing to study `Natural Language Processing`
  - Do more Kaggle competitions compared to courses wrt [last year](https://github.com/ajinkyakolhe112/Mastering-Deep-Learning-in-2023)
- NLP Landscape's two entry points
  - DL Basics -> CNN -> RNN -> LSTM -> Word2Vec -> Attention -> LLMs
  - DL Basics -> **Attention** -> LLMs
