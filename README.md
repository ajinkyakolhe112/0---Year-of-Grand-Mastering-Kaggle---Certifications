# How I am learning Artificial Intelligence in 2024
- Study `Natural Language Processing`
  - & continue learning Image Generation with `Diffusers`
- Apply knowledge to projects

## Improvements from '2023 Learning Experience'
Details: [last year's Computer Vision](https://github.com/ajinkyakolhe112/Mastering-Deep-Learning-in-2023)
Things I am improving
  - Focus on high level libraries like `transformers` and `diffusers` over `pytorch`
    - Advantage: Few lines to have end to end pipeline
    - Advantage: Getting to solution quickly instead of 2 weeks of implementing from scratch
  - Do more Kaggle competitions compared to courses.    (10 courses & 3 competitions last year, Aiming for 10+ competitions this year)
  - Continue coding in pytorch, build code cookbook for experimentation
  - Visualize model internals to understand it better.  (Didn't do this part last year)
  - Understand maths aspect of neural networks.         (Didn't do this part last year.)

## Lessons Learned in 2024
- Landscape of standard LLM architectures, once memorized, a lot of problems become a lot simpler
- Projects are the best way to learn. Deep Learning is a field of experimentation, not theoratical field. That is why projects are the best way to learn.
- State of the art models require bigger GPUs. Free T4 GPU has 16GB of VRAM, can only store 8 Billion parameter model. 
- LLama models are the best models open source AI models, which are as commercial AI models like GPT-4 and Google AI

## Remaining Study Topics
- Research Papers on diffusion models & transformer models optimizations
- Reinforcement Learning
- Custom Dataset building & fine tuning models
- Model Optimization 

## NLP Study Plan
NLP Landscape's two entry paths. One slow, long & easier path & other short but steep path
  - Long & Slow path:   DL Basics -> Simple NN -> CNN -> RNN -> LSTM -> Word2Vec -> Attention -> LLMs
  - Short & Steep path: DL Basics -> **Attention is all you need** -> LLMs
    - Everything in NLP & CV is building on top of this single paper. Highest citations, highest used architecture, is most varied kinds of problems.
    - Understand this thoroughly, because everything builds on this

### Tensorflow Certification Exam 
- Good Certificate for knowledge validation
- But exam has closed now. No pytorch certification. Currently there is no good gap.
- Studied, learned it, but `Failed` because things like getting accuracy above a certain number.

### (Pivot to Projects) Projects -> Applications for a Industry
- Interesting industries as application
- I love books. So projects / industries around books would be - Book to Illustrated Images or Book's adaption to Film / Tv Series. 
- I also love video games. Any application in video game building pipeline
  - Found out in further research, Video Game Industry is bigger than Books + Movies + Tv Series + Music. 
- `Harry Potter` - immersive book or video game or a film
- `Unreal Engine 5` for `Video Games`
- `Screenplays` for `Film making of Harry Potter`
- I have loved `Dune` too. So studied `Screenplay` of Dune as well
- `Mahabharat Video Game`
- Researching `Mahabharat`
- Reading `Harry Potter series`
