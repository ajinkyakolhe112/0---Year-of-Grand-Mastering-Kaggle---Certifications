## Mastering Deep Learning in 2024
- Continuing the journey from [Mastering Deep Learning from 2023](https://github.com/ajinkyakolhe112/Mastering-Deep-Learning-in-2023)
- Deep Learning is **"both, a Science and an Engineering domain"**
  - Both domains have completely different & generally philosphies
  - **Science** is concerned with       - *Theory, How & Why*
  - **Engineering** is concerned with   - *How & Hacking with Code & Applications*
  - We need to master both, not just one. Naturally we have one dominant style, so for mastery, eventually we need to master both styles
  - Different kinds of Data Scientist
    | Scientist   | Engineer       |

- My **focus in 2024 in on Engineering side of Data Science**. Hence will focus more on solving Kaggle Problems, Other Business Problems etc...
